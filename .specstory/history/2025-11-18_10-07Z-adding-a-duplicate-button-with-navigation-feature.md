I'll help you add a duplicate button to the create-game-page component. Let me first examine the current file to understand its structure. Now I'll add a duplicate button to the page. I'll place it near the delete button in the bottom section, and create a `duplicateGame()` method that will create a copy of the current game and navigate to the newly created entity. 
```

```

```

```
Let me check the `EventsService` to understand the return type of `createEvent`: Now I need to check the return type. Let me look at how `createGame()` uses it: I see - there's a commented out navigation line. The service returns a Supabase response. Let me update the `duplicateGame` method to properly handle the response and use `.select()` to get the created data: 
```

```
Perfect! Now let me verify the changes are error-free: Great! Now let me check if the translation key exists in the translation files: I need to add the translation for "duplicate-game". Let me update both language files: 
```

```
I see the English JSON file has an issue. Let me check the actual format of that line: I see the problem - there are literal `\n` characters in the JSON instead of actual newlines. Let me fix this file: 
```

```
Now let me add the German translation too: 
```

```
Perfect! Now let me verify there are no errors: Perfect! Let me create a quick summary of the changes:

## Summary

I've successfully added a duplicate button to the create-game-page component with the following changes:

### 1. **Added Duplicate Button** (`create-game-page.component.ts`)
   - Placed between "See Rotation Preview" link and "Delete Game" button
   - Uses a duplicate/copy icon (overlapping squares)
   - Only shown when editing an existing game (when `id` has a value)

### 2. **Implemented `duplicateGame()` Method**
   - Creates a copy of the current game/training event
   - Appends " (Copy)" to the title to distinguish it from the original
   - Removes the ID so a new record is created
   - Directly inserts via Supabase to get the new event's ID
   - **Navigates to the newly created event** automatically after successful creation
   - Shows success/error notifications

### 3. **Added Translations**
   - English: "Duplicate Game"
   - German: "Spiel duplizieren"
   - Fixed JSON formatting issues in the English translation file

The duplicate functionality now allows you to quickly create a copy of any game or training session, and you'll be automatically redirected to the new entity after creation, making it easy to make adjustments to the duplicate.
